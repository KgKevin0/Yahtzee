# Yahtzee Game in Python

## Project Overview

This project implements the classic dice game Yahtzee in Python. Developed under a tight time constraint of three days in a team of two, this project showcases not only a comprehensive implementation of the Yahtzee game but also demonstrates effective team collaboration through pair programming.

Yahtzee is a turn-based game where players roll five dice and attempt to score points by achieving specific combinations. The game consists of thirteen rounds, and in each round, a player may roll the dice up to three times and then must choose a scoring category. The game encourages strategic thinking as players must decide which combinations to aim for based on their previous rolls.

## Technical Skills and Learning

### Technologies Used
- **Python**: The entire game is implemented in Python, showcasing proficiency in this programming language.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: The game is developed in a Jupyter Notebook, demonstrating the ability to work in diverse development environments.

### Programming Techniques and Methodologies
- **Procedural Programming**: The game follows a procedural programming paradigm, with a clear structure and use of functions to manage different aspects of the game.
- **State Management**: Managing the game state through dictionaries and lists, keeping track of players' scores, available combinations, and overall game progress.
- **User Input and Output**: Handling user input robustly with error handling and providing clear output to guide the player through the game.

### Challenges and Resolutions
- **Game Logic**: Implementing the complex scoring and game progression logic of Yahtzee, ensuring accuracy and adherence to game rules.
- **User Interaction**: Creating a user-friendly interface in a console-based environment, ensuring clear instructions and feedback are provided to players.
- **Code Organization**: Structuring the code in a clean and maintainable way, using functions and clear naming conventions.

### Learning Outcomes
- **Problem Solving**: Developing problem-solving skills through the implementation of game logic and user interaction.
- **Software Design**: Learning about software design principles, functional decomposition, and creating a maintainable codebase.
- **Python Proficiency**: Enhancing proficiency in Python, including its data structures, control flow, and input/output capabilities.
- **Team Collaboration**: Experiencing pair programming and collaborative development, learning to communicate ideas effectively and work together towards a common goal.

## User Guidance

### Prerequisites
- Python (3.x recommended)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, if you want to run the game in a notebook environment)

### Setup and Running the Game
1. Clone or download the project repository.
2. If using Jupyter Notebook, open the file and run all cells. If using Python directly, you can copy the code into a Python script.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game. Each player will take turns rolling the dice and choosing scoring combinations.
